# Clip-path Tooltips
 
1. If you need to resize tooltips (e.g. enlarge them) you probably will need to change their absolute position and clip-path property. Clip-path is responsible for arrows and border-radius.

2. If you don't need border-radius, just use great tool Clippy to generate tooltip clip-path code.

3. If you need just one tooltip, you can merge .tooltip:hover:after with the code of --right/left/top/bottom tooltip.
